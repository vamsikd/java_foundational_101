# L15 - For Loop (Classic & Enhanced)

Source: `L15_for_loop/ForLoop.java`

## Purpose
Counted / indexed iteration and simple traversal (enhanced for-each) over arrays/collections.

## Classic Syntax
`for (init; condition; update) { body }` — init once, then condition → body → update.

## Patterns
Counting up/down, custom step, dual indices, omitted clauses, infinite + break, nested loops, accumulation, search, building strings, labeled break (sparingly).

## Enhanced For-Each
`for (Type elem : arrayOrIterable) { }` — read-only, no index, no safe structural modification.

## Limitations (For-Each)
No index, cannot remove safely (except iterator), cannot sync two collections, assigning loop variable doesn’t mutate original element.

## Pitfalls
Off-by-one (`<= length`), forgotten update (if moved), modifying collection during for-each, heavy string concat in loop, expensive call in condition.

## Best Practices
Keep header simple, use descriptive indices, prefer enhanced for for read-only, StringBuilder for text accumulation, measure before micro-optimizing.

## Mini Practice
- Reverse comma-separated list 10..1.
- First even > 100 index search.
- Two-pointer symmetry check.

## Takeaway
Choose classic for for precise control; enhanced for for clarity when only values matter.
