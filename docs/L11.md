# L11 - Conditionals (if / else / ternary)

Source: `L11_conditionals_if/ConditionalsIf.java`

## Purpose
Control flow branching with if, else-if chains, guard clauses, and ternary operator.

## Forms
- Simple if
- if / else
- if / else-if / else chain
- Nested if (prefer shallow)
- Ternary expression (value selection)

## Patterns
Guard clauses, multi-range classification, flag checks, nested gating, ternary assignment.

## Best Practices
- Always use braces for clarity.
- Use guard clauses to reduce nesting.
- Short-circuit logical operators protect against nulls.
- Keep conditions readable; extract methods if complex.

## Pitfalls
Dangling else (missing braces), deep nesting, redundant `== true`, unreachable branches, overusing ternary.

## Mini Practice
- Refactor nested age & membership check with guard.
- Build a grading chain.
- Write absolute value via ternary.
- Apply De Morgan to simplify `!(a && b)`.

## Takeaway
Readable conditionals hinge on clear boolean expressions, minimal nesting, and judicious ternary usage.
