# L14 - Do-While Loop

Source: `L14_do_while_loop/DoWhileLoop.java`

## Purpose
Post-test loop guaranteeing at least one execution (menus, first-pass initialization).

## Differences vs While
Condition checked after body; min iterations = 1. Use only when first run must happen irrespective of condition.

## Patterns
Menu prompt, retry with max attempts, sentinel probe, controlled break/continue.

## Best Practices
Short condition, mutate state every pass, prefer while if zero iterations acceptable, limit continue usage.

## Pitfalls
Forcing use when while clearer, unchanged condition (infinite), overly complex trailing condition, skipping needed updates with continue.

## Mini Practice
- Menu until 'q'.
- Password retry (max 3, then lockout).
- Convert to while where initial run not required.

## Takeaway
Intentional first execution: choose do-while deliberately, not by habit.
