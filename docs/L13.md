# L13 - While Loop

Source: `L13_while_loop/WhileLoop.java`

## Purpose
Pre-test loop for unknown iteration counts driven by changing state, input, or sentinels.

## Patterns
Counting, sentinel search, input validation, infinite + break, skip via continue.

## Best Practices
- Ensure progress toward termination.
- Keep condition simple; compute support vars before loop.
- Use descriptive flags (`found`, `done`).
- Minimize scattered breaks.

## Pitfalls
Missing update (infinite), wrong bound (`<= length`), hidden side effects in condition, misused continue skipping updates.

## Mini Practice
- Sum until total exceeds 1_000.
- Find first negative index.
- Convert for to equivalent while.
- Input validation rejecting blank.

## Takeaway
Use while when you may run zero times and termination depends on evolving runtime state.
