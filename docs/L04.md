# L04 - Operators

Source: `L04_Operators.java`

## Overview
Arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise, shift, ternary, and concatenation operators with pitfalls and safety habits.

## Categories
- Arithmetic: + - * / %
- Unary: + - ++ --
- Comparison: == != < <= > >=
- Logical (short-circuit): && || !
- Bitwise: & | ^ ~
- Shifts: << >> >>>
- Ternary: condition ? a : b
- String concat: + (one operand String)

## Key Notes
- Integer division truncates toward 0.
- `%` remainder sign follows dividend.
- Floating equality: compare with tolerance.
- ++/--: avoid multiple modifications of same variable in one expression.
- Compound assignments can hide overflow (implicit cast back).

## Bitwise & Shifts
Use for masks/flags, performance-critical low-level work. Remember shift counts mask (n & 0x1F for int).

## Common Pitfalls
| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|------|-----|
| Truncation | 5/2 = 2 | Use 5/2.0 or cast |
| Overflow | 2_000_000_000 * 2 | Promote to long first |
| Concat order | "A"+1+2 â†’ A12 | Parenthesize arithmetic |
| Floating == | 0.1+0.2 != 0.3 | Use epsilon compare |

## Best Practices
- Parenthesize for clarity over relying on precedence.
- Isolate side effects (separate increments).
- Use Math.*Exact for intentional overflow checking (later lesson).

## Mini Practice
- Show `&` vs `&&` evaluation difference.
- Build a mask using shifts then extract a field.
- Write nested ternary categorizing number sign.

## Takeaway
Operators compose logic; clarity and awareness of promotion/overflow prevent subtle bugs.
